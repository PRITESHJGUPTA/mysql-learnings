## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is an essential tool for managing and interacting with relational databases. As part of my computer engineering studies and personal development, I decided to learn SQL in depth. This repository serves as both a personal reference and a resource for anyone interested in following a similar path.

> **Current Focus:** Mastering advanced SQL concepts including indexing, optimization, and stored procedures.

## Learning Path 🚀

- **Basic SQL Queries:** Getting started with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **Intermediate Concepts:** Joins, subqueries, aggregate functions.
- **Advanced Topics:** Indexing, query optimization, stored procedures, and triggers.
- **Projects:** Practical projects applying the learned concepts.

## Folder Structure 🗂️

Each folder within this repository is organized by date, documenting my progress and the concepts I learned on that day. This structure allows me to track my learning over time and revisit specific topics as needed.
